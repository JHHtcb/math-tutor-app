Testing Plan
E2E Test.  Happy Path:
1. Page opens successfully
2. Enter the correct answer (adding the two numbers)
3. The Answer button is now selectable.
4. Select the “Answer” button.
5. Pop-up window displays with text “That's right! Try another one.”
6. Pop-Up window is closed
7. New numbers are presented for a new challenge.
8. The answer field has been cleared
9. The Answer button is no longer enabled.


Improvements to the Happy Path
add screen shots showing the value being entered

Additional Functional Tests – that can be incorporated into the E2E automation workflow:
-Verify that every number character can be entered, including the decimal point enabling the Answer button to be selectable. (0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, “.”)
-Verify only real(?) numbers can be entered into the answer field
    E.G.  99999999, 0, 0.9999999, +5555, -5555
-Verify that if a character(s) that can be entered is not a number, the Answer button is not enabled (“e”, “2+4”, “5-3”)  [even if the math equation entered yields the correct answer)
-Verify that the characters entered can be cleared out by the user (either with the delete button or the backspace button)
    This should be the case before the 'Answer' button is selected and when a wrong answer is submitted
-Verify that the popup showing the answer is correct or it is not correct auto closes within 7 seconds.
-Verify that the popup showing the answer is correct or it is not correct can be closed by clicking in it within 5 seconds of it appearing.

Non-Functional Tests:
-Compatibility:  Verify the happy path test functions across different browsers (Windows: Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Mac: Safari)
-508:  Check for section 508 accessibility.  E.G. ability to use only the keyboard.
-Stess:  Add an extremely lengthy value as the answer.
-Response time.  Measure how quickly the page responds to each click.
