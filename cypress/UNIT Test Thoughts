UNIT TESTS:
Application code usually lives the in src folder for Angular projects. 
In the src folder should be an app folder â€“ which contains core logic, services, components, directives, pipes and models.

Components that could use Unit Tests include:
    calculator.service.ts 
    message.service.ts 
    app.module.ts   (Disable button when there is no answer )
